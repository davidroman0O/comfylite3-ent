# Comfylite3 and Ent Framework

A very simple integration with that third-party.

I personally love this combo: 
- [`comfylite3`](https://github.com/davidroman0O/comfylite3): the fastest SQLite wrapper that works effortlessly with concurrent scenarios
- [`ent`](https://github.com/ent/ent/): an excellent entity framework 

When programming alone or creating apps to solve personal problems, you don't want to bother with detailsâ€”you just want to move quickly. At least I do. With `comfylite3` and `ent`, I can skip the whole database design phase and get straight to the point!
